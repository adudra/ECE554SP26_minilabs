Resource Utilization:

Our Design:
Estimate of Logic utilization (ALMs needed) ; 124 

IP:
Estimate of Logic utilization (ALMs needed) ; 99

The Vendor IPs are often highly optimized for the FPGA 
architecture. Our design could been  less efficient,
or have been synthesized using more generic blocks, making
it less optimal.
