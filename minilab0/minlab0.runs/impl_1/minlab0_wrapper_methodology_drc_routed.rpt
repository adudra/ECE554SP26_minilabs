2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on enable_0 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[5] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[6] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on dout_0[7] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_pl_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin minlab0_i/rom_ctrl_0/inst/addr_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 3 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
